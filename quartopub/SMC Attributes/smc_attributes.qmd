> **SMC** (**S**upplier-**M**anaged **C**harging) allows the utility to monitor, manage, and restrict BEV charging to optimize energy flow **during night charging at home**. By SMC, your BEV will be mostly charged during off-peak periods.

**Sample SMC Program** (Considering max range of **200** miles):

1.  You get one-time payment of **\$300** if you stay for at least 3 months.
2.  You get recurring monthly payment of **\$20** if you don't exceed override allowance for that month.
3.  Freely override to normal charging for up to **5** times per month, each time effective for 24 hrs.
4.  SMC won't be triggered if battery is below **80** miles.
5.  SMC will give you guaranteed **160** miles by the morning (8 hrs' charging).
