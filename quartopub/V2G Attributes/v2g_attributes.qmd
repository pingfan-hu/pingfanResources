> **V2G** (**V**ehicle-**to**-**G**rid) lets your vehicle supply the grid as external power during peak times, reducing the need for additional battery storage and benefiting the environment.
>
> If you enroll, your utility may purchase electricity from your car as needed. You'll receive prior notification, and your vehicle will be recharged to a guaranteed range in the end.

**Sample V2G Program** (Considering max range of **200** miles):

1.  You get one-time payment of **\$300** if you stay for at least 3 months.
2.  You are compensated **\$20** each time the V2G event occurs.
3.  The V2G event occurs **1** time per month.
4.  V2G won't drain your battery below **80** miles.
5.  Your battery will be charged back to at least **160** miles with 8 hrs' charging.

**V2G Attributes Explained:**

    `1` = c("Enrollment Cash", "$50, $100, $200, $300", "The one-time payment you'll receive if you stay for at least 3 months."),
    `2` = c("Occurrence Cash", "$2, $5, $10, $15, $20", "The amount you'll earn for each occurrence of V2G."),
    `3` = c("Monthly Occurrence", "1, 2, 3, 4", "The monthly occurrence of V2G."),
    `4` = c("Lower Bound", "20%, 30%, 40%", "(See battery bar) V2G won't drain your battery below this percentage. Converted to miles."),
    `5` = c("Guaranteed Threshold", "60%, 70%, 80%", "(See battery bar) V2G will charge your battery back to this percentage with 8 hrs' charging. Converted to miles."))
